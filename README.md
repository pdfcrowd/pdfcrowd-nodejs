# node-pdfcrowd

A wrapper for the Pdfcrowd API which lets you convert web pages and raw HTML code to PDF.

You must have an account on
[http://pdfcrowd.com](https://pdfcrowd.com). This will give you a
username and an API key. Here is the
[API overview](https://pdfcrowd.com/html-to-pdf-api/).

## Installation

To install via npm:

    $ npm install pdfcrowd

Or clone from GitHub and create a symlink in `~/.node_libraries`:

    $ git clone git@github.com:pdfcrowd/node-pdfcrowd.git
    $ ln -s /path/to/node-pdfcrowd ~/.node_libraries/pdfcrowd


Dependencies

* http *native module*
* querystring *native module*
* fs *native module*

## Getting Started

The following code converts raw HTML code to PDF and returns it in an
HTTP
[response](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http.html#http.ServerResponse)
(don't forget to use your `"username"` and `"apikey"`):

    var pdf = require('pdfcrowd');

    var client = new pdf.Pdfcrowd('username', 'apikey');
    client.convertHtml('<html>regular HTML code</html>', pdf.sendHttpResponse(response));

If for some reason you want to disable https, pass `false` as the last argument:

    var client = new pdf.Pdfcrowd('username', 'apikey', 'pdfcrowd.com', false);

You can convert also a web page and save it to a file:

    client.convertURI('http://example.com', pdf.saveToFile("example_com.pdf"));

Or a local HTML file:

    client.convertFile('/local/file.html', pdf.saveToFile("file.pdf"));

The generated PDF can be customized:

    client.convertURI(
        'http://example.com',
        pdf.saveToFile("example_com.pdf"),
        {
            width: "11in",
            height: "8.5in",
            vmargin: ".4in",
            footer_html: '<div style=text-align:center;font-size:smaller;color:maroon;">\
                              Page %p out of %n\
                          </div>'
        });
